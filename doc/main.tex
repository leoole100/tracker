\section{Introduction}
Real-time object tracking is a core challenge in computer vision and robotics. This project focuses on moving a camera to track a ping pong ball during gameplay, which presents a unique combination of steady ballistic flight and rapid, complex bounces at high speeds. These dynamics make it an interesting platform to explore and evaluate detection, tracking, and control strategies.

% \subsection{Requirements}
To simplify the exploration of different strategies, the system is designed with modularity and accessibility in mind. Each component is built around high-level concepts, enabling users to experiment without requiring an in-depth engineering background.
