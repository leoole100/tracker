# Tracker
This project explores modular real-time computer control through the development of a target tracking camera gimbal. Emphasizing distributed processing and modular software design, it serves as an experimental platform for studying and advancing computer-controlled systems.
The electronics are developed in a [different project](http://github.com/leoole100/servo).
